# Context

Previously, I had ensured that students were solid with regards to solving linear equations, re-arranging equations and transposing formulas, and constructing linear equations from a worded problem. The time then came to tackle simultaneous equations: constructing and solving them. The aim was for students to be able to answer this type of question:



Last year when I taught this unit, I followed the method that I was taught: using substitution and elimination. The students struggled a bit, but, to be fair, at that point I was only in my 6th or 7th week of teaching and didn't know all that I know now. I took all the lessons I learned and spent a fair amount of time planning for this particular lesson (which was focused around solving simultaneous equations).

# Setup

Instead of teaching through substitution and elimination, I was inspired by a flow chart in the textbook we used:

I'm a big fan of using flow charts in maths, as it models the decision making process that an expert may go through when approaching particular problems. Using the flowchart, I identified six types of simultaneous equations that students may encounter:


For each type, I created two example-problem pairs. I would model the example with explanations and annotations, after which the students copy into their notes, and would do the problem on their mini whiteboards. This is done twice (or more if needed).

Before the instruction commenced, I checked the students' ability to solve and re-arrange a range of linear equations using mini whiteboards. I then had students glue in a number of sheets into their workbook and we were ready to go.

# The Lesson

I use a visualiser extensively in my classes (since the start of the year) and it has been a game changer, and the kids love it to. So when I modelled the example, the students see exactly how I would set out the problem on the page. For example:

I started the instruction with a preamble about how solving a linear equation with one variable gives us a single solution. But, when I have one equation with two unknowns and solve (or re-arrange) it, my answer includes the other unknown. If I wanted to solve this completely, I would need another equation. When I have two or more equations like this they are called simultaneous equations. I then explained that they are only solvable when I have as many equations as I have unknowns. So solving simultaneous equations becomes useful when I'm trying to find the value of two or more unknowns.
