# Context

I've recently been playing around with [GeoGebra](https://www.geogebra.org/), a piece dynamic geometry software, over the holidays. My challenge has been to learn the software by way of taking mathematical concepts and illustrating them. An example below:

<iframe scrolling="no" title="Instantaneous Slope First Principles" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/dvxbcmud/width/1280/height/636/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false" width="1280px" height="636px" style="border:0px;"> </iframe>

I learned much of the basics from [this blog](http://mathandmultimedia.com/geogebra-tutorials/), and my own programming experience.

Whenever I am constructing these I am always thinking about how this will look to the students (particularly if it is the first time they are seeing the concept) by considering cognitive load. Additionally, I have been read that it is important for students to be able to compare a before and after representation in order to glean insights based on the concepts of sameness and difference (which can be missed when something is animated). For example, illustrating the 3- and 5-moving mean (from statistics):

<iframe scrolling="no" title="Moving Mean" src="https://www.geogebra.org/material/iframe/id/whxwwvzf/width/1280/height/636/border/888888/sfsb/true/smb/false/stb/false/stbh/false/ai/false/asb/false/sri/false/rc/false/ld/false/sdz/false/ctl/false" width="1280px" height="636px" style="border:0px;"> </iframe>

In saying that, some concepts are dynamic in nature (such as Instantaneous Slope), so representing it this way (as opposed to statically) is key to comprehending it. A good feature of these apps is that they can be revisited by students later.

# Pedagogy

Additionally, I am keeping in mind how these apps will be presented to students, and what I want them thinking about. This can take one of two forms:

* Teacher demonstration

  * Good for being able to control how the concept is delivered and demonstrated.
  * Can supplement a verbal/written explanation.
  * Students could be asked to write what they are seeing.
* Student interaction

  * Students can explore aspects that they are curious about.
  * Need to be careful about students aimlessly playing around without gleaning any insights (structured questions could help with this).
  * Requires technology (that I have found is logistically challenging).

# Repository

This endeavour presents an intellectual challenge both pedagogically and intellectually.This page will contain links to GeoGebra apps that I have constructed (and continue to play around with). Any feedback/comments are welcome.
