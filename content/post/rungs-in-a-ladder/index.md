After watching [Tom Sherrington’s magnificent ResearchEd Home talk ](https://youtu.be/JZGpFfsZuuk)the other day, my mind has been racing with thoughts around curriculum.

I don’t think curriculum receives enough attention (in Australia). Now and again it comes up in the media along with words and phrases such as “[overcrowded](https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/push-to-strip-back-crowded-school-syllabus/news-story/3d1d60652c90317b7d8b94cb4516faa1)”, “[outdated](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2018/apr/30/australia-must-overhaul-industrial-school-model-says-gonski-chaired-review)” or “[back-to-basics](https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/education-minister-pushes-for-back-to-basics-approach-in-schools-20191209-p53i7z.html)”. But I think the curriculum is far more than dot points on a website. As Tom puts it, then curriculum is supposed to be a carefully thought journey of knowledge, skills, understandings and experiences for each subject across the entire schooling lifetime of students. Each lesson or unit is then a segment of that journey, that builds on what was learned previously and is a foundation for what is to come. Every teacher of that subject should therefore be fully apprised of the whole map and how each part contributes to the whole.

Importantly is the idea of [knowledge building upon knowledge](https://sites.google.com/view/efratfurst/learning-in-the-brain?authuser=0). This is based on our understanding of schema formation as the process of learning. If any of the building blocks are weak (or absent), the capacity for a student to learn something new is compromised. I like the analogy of rungs in a ladder, each one being placed as you climb higher. However, if the rung we want students to place is placed too high, they will struggle to reach it. And even if they do, what results is a patchwork of rungs that makes for a highly unaesthetic ladder.

What has been bugging me is how important prior knowledge is for new learning, and yet the drive to get through the curriculum means that I don’t check whether students are secure before moving on. Rather, I accept that there will be a bell curve of achievement. I’m afraid to go back and teach what isn’t there. Part of that stems from my lack of knowledge of the maths curriculum as a whole (I don’t know where to go back to), and the time and workload required to rigorously check and do something about. Then there’s the students self-perception that might be damaged if I say we’re going back rather than moving forward.

Yet it is vital that I do. I like the [Mastery Model ](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/58e151c946c3c418501c2f88/1534426850332-ERQ0ECPJ40PMZO73B6EL/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kAH9TjSF6fI3ZurIfvAFuwxZw-zPPgdn4jUwVcJE1ZvWQUxwkmyExglNqGp0IvTJZUJFbgE-7XRK3dMEBRBhUpw8oNhsGhlNYWUmPaquamMJJ2yMWcBXoAQ-MSdchYOfe0ZrRrxrkAmXoAmxVC9lN3s/Mastery-Learning-Cycle.png?format=1500w)put forward by Mark McCourt where the first step in the teaching of a unit is to check for prior knowledge and provide correctives for those that need, and enrichment to those who are ready. Then at the end of a unit and following a summative test instead of doing a pointless test revision session, I provide the corrective teaching required for the students who did not do well, and enrichment for others, and not move on until the majority of my students are successful. Sounds easy to do, but I know it’s a lot of effort. I also fear I’m missing a lot of subject knowledge and experience (being only a second year teacher). However, it’s the right thing to do for my students.

This is why the curriculum thinking and planning is vital. It doesn’t leave learning to accident, rather it is based on what we know about learning. It also saves time and stress in the long run. Most importantly, no student is left behind and leaves school with a complex, rich schema to take with them in their adult life.
