I am a second year teacher at a P-12 school in regional Victoria, Australia. Working and studying through the Teach for Australia Leadership Development Program. I am passionate about the inherent joy of learning, and helping others expand their opportunities through education.

This blog is a repository of my teaching of mathematics and science, as well as musings about education as a whole.
